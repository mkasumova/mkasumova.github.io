    <h1>Possible Images for My Website!</h1>    
    <h2>"Here is My Story"</h2>
    <p>I used the playful term of "story" to describe my life in my Exercise 1. I think this photo fits well with my writer theme, and my "story" motif.</p>

<h2>Yoga</h2>
<p>I think an interesting part of me is that I love doing yoga and meditating. I might include this photo in my resume section where I list my hobbies.</p>

<h2>Handmade Collage</h2>
<p>I may include samples of my artwork and other creative projects in my portfolio, and this is a cool collage that I may include!</p>
